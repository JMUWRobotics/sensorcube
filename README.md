# Sensor Cube
Documentation, design and example code for the Sensor Cube used for teaching at the Robotics Lab of the Julius Maximilian University of WÃ¼rzburg.
* The sensors can be used without specialized drivers. The stereo camera behaves like a webcam. The Arduino offers a virtual serial port over USB with sensor messages in JSON format.

## Configuration
In the root directory is a configuration file _"config.json"_. Please make sure to set _"serial\_port"_ (typically _"/dev/ttyACM[0-9]"_ on Linux or _"COM[1-9]"_ on Windows) and the correct _"camera\_index"_ for the stereo camera.

```
"config.json":
  {
    "serial_port" : "/dev/ttyACM0",
    "serial_baudrate" : 921600,
    "camera_index" : 0,
    "camera_width" : 1600,
    "camera_height": 600
  }
```

The Python examples load this file relative to the _*.py_ source files. For the C++ examples CMake sets the path relative to the project source dir and bakes the path in the executables.

## Udev Rules Setup
On GNU/Linux make sure that you have access rights for the serial device (typically _"/dev/ttyACM[0-9]"_) of the Arduino in the Sensor Cube. On Debian/Ubuntu the device will have access rights for the group _plugdev_. Make sure your user is in the group _plugdev_.

Alternatively, the repository includes a udev rule, which grants read and write access to the device for all users:
```
sudo cp udev/99-sensorcube.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

## Using the Sensor Cube with Python
Set up your Python programming environment.

* Install Python3. On GNU/Linux you can use your favorite package manager to install Python, e.g., on Debian/Ubuntu install the package:
  ```
  sudo apt install python3
  ```
* On GNU/Linux use your favorite package manager to install the Python dependencies, e.g., on Debian/Ubuntu install the packages:
  ```
  sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-serial python3-matplotlib python3-numpy
  ```
  Or, use _pip_ to install the dependencies:
  ```
  $ pip install opencv-python pyserial matplotlib numpy
  ```
* Inspect the Python examples in the directory [_examples/python_](examples/python).

## Using the Sensor Cube with C++
Set up your C++ programming environment.

* Set up your C++ programming environment and compiler, e.g., _GCC_ on GNU/Linux or _Visual Studio/MSVC_ on Windows.
* Install the _OpenCV_ library.

  For image processing we will be using the _OpenCV_ library which is available	across platforms. It is recommended to use version 4.5.4. However, any version newer than 4.4.0 should be fine to complete the assignments.

  Please refer to: https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.4/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html

  GNU/Linux: Use your favorite package manager to install OpenCV, e.g., on Debian/Ubuntu install the package:
  ```
  sudo apt install libopencv-dev
  ```
  Windows: You can download the _OpenCV_ binary release from https://opencv.org/releases/. You need to add the path to the unpacked directory _"opencv/build/x64/vc16/bin"_ to your System Path, such that the _OpenCV_ DLLs are found.
  
  Of course it is also possible to compile OpenCV yourself or use other ways for the installation as listed in the _OpenCV_ documentation.
* Install the _CMake_ build system.

  GNU/Linux: Use your favorite package manager to install _CMake_, e.g., on Debian/Ubuntu install the package:
  ```
  sudo apt install cmake
  ```
  Windows: You can download _CMake_ from https://cmake.org/download/.
  
* All other library dependencies (_Eigen3_, _Nlohmann JSON_, and _Asio_) are automatically downloaded by _CMake_. Inspect the _"examples/cpp/CMakeLists.txt"_ project file.
* Build the C++ examples. The recommended way of building a project with _CMake_ is by doing an out-of-source build. This can be done like this:
  ```
  $ cd examples/cpp
  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  ```
  If _OpenCV_ is not installed in the standard paths, you might need to set the _OpenCV_ directory:
  ```
  $ cmake -DOpenCV_DIR=<Path to directory OpenCVConfig.cmake> ..
  ```
  If you are using the _OpenCV_ binary release on Windows, you need to specify the path to the unpacked directory _"opencv/build/x64/vc16/lib"_.

  Different _CMake_ Generators are available, such as _Unix Makefiles_ or _Ninja_. On Windows CMake can create, for example, _Visual Studio_ project files, _NMake_, or _Unix Makefiles_: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html
	
  For example, on Windows you can run from the Visual Studio developer command prompt:
  ```
  $ cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
  $ nmake
  ```
* Inspect the C++ examples in the directory [_examples/cpp/src_](examples/cpp/src).

## Tools
* Record messages:
  ```
  python3 recordMessages.py -m <message_type> -f <file_name>
  ```
  Example record _imu_raw_ data to file _imu_raw.json_:
  ```
  python3 recordMessages.py -m imu_raw -f imu_raw.json
  ```
* Print messages:
  Without the file option _-f_ you can also use the record tool to print the messages.
  ```
  python3 recordMessages.py -m <message_type>
  ```
* Plot raw IMU data:
  ```
  python3 showIMU.py
  ```
* Capture Images:
  ```
  python3 captureCamera.py
  ```
  Press spacebar to capture images and ESC to quit.

* Update Real Time Clock:
  ```
  python3 setTime.py
  ```
## Known Issues
* The Arduino UNO R4 WiFi uses the internal oscillator instead of an external crystal as a clock source for the Real Time Clock (RTC). This causes significant time drift.
* The stereo camera can be slow with _OpenCV_ Video Capture. Therefore, the default configuration uses a stereo image size of only 1600 x 600.
